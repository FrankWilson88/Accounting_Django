# Accounting_Django
A GAAP Double Entry Accounting system in Django
It's basically just broken up into Django, then raw SQL with a GUI I wanted to start working on.
In the Django folder, it's just divided by frontend and backend. So the website is in the frontend folder, and the accounting code is in the backend folder.
